Rumpel is a tiny r package containing convenience functions for manipulating
objects by their names. 

Functions that start with `named` return a subset of the original
object:

```{r}
library(rumpel)
library(magrittr)

vec <- c(one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4)
vec %>% named("one")
vec %>% named_like("^t")
```

Functions that start with `rename` return the object with its
names changed:

```{r}
vec <- c(one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4)
vec %>% rename_gsub("[aeiou]", "e")
vec %>% rename_toupper()
```

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
